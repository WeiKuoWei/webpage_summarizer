# webpage_summarizer

Next steps/fix:
- The current chatbot does not have memory and do not have reference to the webpage that is being summarized.
  - Explore methods to keep conversation history and use it for the chatbot.
  - Explore the use of Simple Vector Store to temporarily store the webpage content and use it for the chatbot.
- After minimizing layover, users cannot drag the layover for repositioning the layover.
- At the moment, it is also not possible to resize the layover/floating window.
- There should be a way to hide the chat box section.
